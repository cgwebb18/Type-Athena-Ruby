    All of the letter keys on the initial keyboard can be manipulated with your physical
    keyboard. The three keys on the initial keyboard that cannot be manipulated
    by your physical keyboard are the extender and the two buttons to switch
    language layouts. Also, the "tab" key will respond to your physical keyboard,
    but it should have no effect on the input. It is simply there as a placeholder
    to make it easier to relate the keys on your physical keyboard to the keys on
    the virtual keyboard.
