  <h1>Instructions</h1>
  <h2>Introduction and Opening the Keyboard</h2>
  <p>
    When you first open the Athena Ruby Keyboard webpage this is what you will
    see:
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking into the input area will open up the virtual keyboard:
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is what the keybooard looks like before you press any buttons:

  <p>
    All of the letter keys on the initial keyboard can be manipulated with your physical
    keyboard. The three keys on the initial keyboard that cannot be manipulated
    by your physical keyboard are the extender and the two buttons to switch
    language layouts. Also, the "tab" key will respond to your physical keyboard,
    but it should have no effect on the input. It is simply there as a placeholder
    to make it easier to relate the keys on your physical keyboard to the keys on
    the virtual keyboard.
  </p>
  <h2>Switching Languages and Alternate Key Popups</h2>
  <p>
    To switch between Latin and Greek simply click on either of the buttons that
    have 'Greek' or 'Latin' on them. Like this:
  </p>

  <p>
    To access the different forms of each character all you have to do is
    hold down that key on your physical keyboard or click it and hold until a popup
    appears. <br /> In this example I first hold down the 'a' key on my physical keyboard
    until I see all the variant forms of the Latin 'a', then I switch languages
    and hold the same 'a' key until I see a popup with all the variant forms of alpha:

  <h2>Keyboard Extenders</h2>
  <p>
    To open the keyboard extenders simply click the extender button:
  </p>
  <img src="gifs/open-extender.gif" alt="Gif of opening the extenders" class="instr-img">
  <p>
    There are seven extenders on the Athena Ruby keyboard: DIA = diacritics, LG1 = Greek ligatures,
    LG2 = Latin ligatures, SUP = Superscripts, LIN = Symbols made of lines, DOT = Symbols made of dots,
    SYM = All other symbols.
  </p>
  <img src="gifs/extenders1.png" alt="Picture with extenders highlighted" class="instr-img">
  <p>
    Here is an example of someone using the extenders:
  </p>

  <p>
    The Diacritics extender has it's own set of alternate key popups so all you have
    to do is hold down one of the diacritics to see all possible combinations with
    vowels.
  </p>

  <h2>Using Copy and History:</h2>
  <p>
    The virtual keyboard remaps the enter button on your physical keyboard so that
    when you press enter, the contents of input are copied to your keyboard. Also,
    every time you copy the input those same characters will appear inside of the
    "History" section.
  </p>
  <img src="gifs/copy.gif" alt="Gif of using the copy button" class="instr-img">
  <p>
    You can click on any of the things you have saved to history and they will
    automatically populate the input area, so that it should be easier to make
    minor adjustments.
